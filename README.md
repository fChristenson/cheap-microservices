# Cheap MicroServices

## What we will cover

* One of the biggest costs of MicroServices
* How to mitigate some of that cost

## Notes

When we split our logic over a distributed system one of the main problems we will face
is to keep our API's in sync.

Models, routes, errors, response codes and the list goes on, 
are some thing we now need to define and maintain.

This is a surprising amount of extra work but we can mitigate some of it.
